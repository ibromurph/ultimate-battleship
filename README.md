<h1>The Why</h1>
<p>Battleship is a strategy type guessing game for two players. It is played on ruled grids (paper or board) on which each player's fleet of ships (including battleships) are marked. The locations of the fleets are concealed from the other player. Players alternate turns calling "shots" at the other player's ships, and the objective of the game is to destroy the opposing player's fleet. The siteâ€™s goal is to provide a challenging game to entertain, but also educate online users into the rules/workings of the game.</p>
<hr>
<h2><b>The Rules</b></h2>
<ol>
<li>The board is 7 x 7</li><li>
Each player has 5 ships</li><li>
Ships are placed randomly</li><li>
Ships cannot overlap with each other</li><li>
Ships cannot be placed in the same position</li><li>
Ships cannot be placed on the edge of the board</li><li>
Players take turns firing shots (calling out grid coordinates)</li><li>
Grid coordinates have the following format (e.g): "1,a", "2,b", "4,e"</li><li>
Players attempt to hit the opponent's enemy ships.</li><li>
When a ship it "hit", it is considered sunk</li><li>
As soon as all of one player's ships have been sunk, the game ends.</li></ol>

<h1>Testing</h1>

<h2>Validator testing</h2>
<p>
<a href="http://pep8online.com/" target="_blank">PEP8 Online</a><br>
The Python code has been tested with the PEP8 Online check validator and <a href="images/PEP8-online-pass.png" target="_blank">passed</a> with no issues.<br><br>



<h2>Device tests</h2>
<p>Testing across the following browsers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Checked the character size and ensuring it fit in the heroku app window</li><li>
Checked conditions around the name of users to ensure it's alphabetic and had no spaces</li><li>
Checked conditions around entering an invalidate co-ordinate outside of grid</li>
<li>Checked conditions around entering the same co-ordinate twice.</li>
<li>Checked conditions using CAPS and lower case in input fields</li>
<li>Checked conditions trying to quit the game.</li>
<li>Checked conditions entering nothing in input fields</li>
</ul>

  </table>
  <p>If I had more time, I would have liked to have done more user testing, especially against the user stories defined above. I was only able to get family members (new users) to test, and no issues were found.</p>
<h2>Bugs & Fixes</h2>
<p>
<ol>
<li><br>FIXED -- Co-ordinates in lowercase was initially considered invalid input</br> Added lowercase to the dictionary, so it related to the same column as uppercase.</li>
<li><br>FIXED -- Computer random selection. Initially the random selection for the computer choice didn't have an escape condition (for when a computer randomly selects the same co-ordinate twice).</br>Added while and if condition which meant that the computer could only return a co-ordinate guess, if the co-ordinate was for an empty cell</li>
<li><br>FIXED -- Player name initially had no checks on it and an empty name field could be entered</br> Added an isalpha() function on name to ensure something [A-Za-z] valid was entered</li>
</ol>

<h1>Deployment</h1>

## Heroku Deployment

To deploy Ultimate Battleship game to Heroku, take the following steps:

1. Create a `requirements.txt` file using the terminal command `pip freeze > requirements.txt`.

2. Create a `Procfile` with the terminal command `echo web: python app.py > Procfile`.

3. `git add` and `git commit` the new requirements and Procfile and then `git push` the project to GitHub.

3. Create a new app on the [Heroku website](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps) by clicking the "New" button in your dashboard. Give it a name and set the region to whichever is applicable for your location.

4. From the heroku dashboard of your newly created application, click on "Deploy" > "Deployment method" and select GitHub.

5. Confirm the linking of the heroku app to the correct GitHub repository.
