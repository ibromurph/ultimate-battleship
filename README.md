<h1>Testing</h1>

<h2>Validator testing</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://validator.w3.org/" target="_blank">HTML Validator</a><br>
The HTML has been tested with the HTML W3 validator and <a href="assets/images/testing/HTML pass.png" target="_blank">passed</a> with no errors. Only one warning surrounding headings order.<br><br>

<a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/" target="_blank">W3C CSS validator</a><br>
The CSS has been tested with the W3C CSS validated and <a href="assets/images/testing/CSS Pass.png" target="_blank">passed</a> with no errors.<br><br>

<a href="https://jshint.com/" target="_blank">JS Hint</a><br>
The game JS file has been passed through JSHint and <a href="assets/images/testing/JS Hint.png" target="_blank">does not show any errors</a>.

<a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse" target="_blank">Chrome Dev Tools - Lighthouse</a><br>
For running the lighthouse tests, I used an incognito window to avoid any errors and issues that could be caused by any of my Chrome extensions. The initial results raised 2 minor issues surrounding a <a href="assets/images/testing/Cross-origin.png" target="_blank">rel="noreferrer" attribute</a> on the 'About the game' CTA (as it was linking off to YouTube). It also raised a small issue on the <a href="assets/images/testing/robots.png" target="_blank">lack of a robots.txt file</a> (for search engines). After resolving these two issues, the game application <a href="assets/images/testing/lighthouse.png" target="_blank">scored 100 across all verticals</a>.



<h2>Device tests</h2>
<p>Testing across the following browsers/devices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Checked the size and placement of the icons on all device screen sizes</li><li>
Confirmed that font size is legible on all screen sizes, especially small and medium screens</li><li>
Checked that buttons and fields are large enough to click but still fit on the screen comfortably</li>
<li>Checked that everything is displayed centrally and fits within the height of the screen.</li>
<li>Checked that the rules buttons could open and close easily.</li>
<li>Checked that the icons </li>
</ul>

  <p>If I had more time, I would have liked to have done more user testing, especially against the user stories defined above. I was only able to get family members (new users) to test, and no issues were found.</p>
<h2>Bugs & Fixes</h2>
<p>
<ol>
<li>FIXED -- JS syntax error. The page was not loading. class Player in JavaScript. <br>Used Chrome DevTools console to see state of page. The user and computer class were 'undefined', so had to move the class Player definition above the initiation.</li>
<li>FIXED -- gameOver text and play again button was not being removed after first game had been completed.<br> Used Chrome DevTools console to see state of page. The issue was that the resetGame function did not initially include the adding of the 'hidden' class on the playAgainButton and gameOverText function call</li>
<li>FIXED -- "main" html tag was throwing up an error in the html validator.<br>
The problem was that the 'main' tag was used twice within a section tag. I resolved this by swapping the two main tags to section tags, and swapping the section tag to main.

<h1>Deployment</h1>
<h2>Vercel</h2>
<p>There are a number of ways to host your project for free. I used <a href="https://vercel.com/" target="_blank">Vercel</a> as it's an amazing service and extremely simple to get set up with. If you'd like to use Vercel, here are some steps to follow to get started:
<ol>
<li><a href="https://vercel.com/signup" target="_blank">Sign up to Vercel</a> and go through the onboarding flow, ensuring your GitHub account is connected by using their <a href="https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/git/vercel-for-gitlab" target="_blank">Vercel for GitHub</a> integration.</li>
<li>Connect your project to Vercel from the <a href="https://vercel.com/import" target="_blank">"Import project" page, using the "From Git Repository" button and selecting the project you want to deploy.</li>
<li>Once connected, every time you <code>git push</code>, Vercel will create a new <a href="https://vercel.com/docs/v2/platform/deployments" target="_blank">deployment</a> and the deployment URL will be shown on your <a href="https://vercel.com/dashboard" target="_blank">Dashboard</a>. You will also receive an email for each deployment with the URL.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<h2>Forking Repository</h2>
<p>Forking the GitHub Repository makes a copy of the original repository so that you can view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository. To do this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">Github</a> and log in.</li>
<li>Locate the repository - follow this link for the <a href="https://github.com/ibromurph/rpsls-game" target="_blank">Rock, Paper, Scissor, Lizard, Spock repository</a></li>
<li>Above the <b>Settings</b> button on the menu, on the right-hand side locate the <b>Fork</b> Button. It is next to the star button.</li>
<li>You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Cloning the project</h2>
<p>To clone from Github:
<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">Github</a> and log in.</li>
<li>Locate the repository - follow this link for the <a href="https://github.com/ibromurph/rpsls-game" target="_blank">Rock, Paper, Scissor, Lizard, Spock repository</a></li>
<li>Under the repository name, click the green <b>Clone or download</b> button.</li>
<li>To clone the repository using HTTPS, copy the link under <b>Clone with HTTPS.</b></li>
<li>Open a terminal and if you need to, change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.</li>
<li>Type <code>git clone</code>, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3 on GitHub.</li>
<br><code>$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY`</code>
<li>When you press Enter, your local clone will be created</li>
</ol>
Further information and troubleshooting on cloning a repository from Github can be found on <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository" target="_blank">GitHub Docs</a>.
